Hi!!

This is a sample text file. Add something below and save it. Then do these steps to push the updated version to github:

git commit -m "updating text file" practice.txt
git pull 
git push 

Details: 
the "-m" in git commit means add messsage, and then you add the message describing the update you did in the file, and then you add the file name
git pull just checks if there is anything new on github that someone else pushed since you last pulled, so it would merge the files if i also updated the same file as you. 
finally, git push pushes the (merged if needed) updated file back to github and you're done! 

If you have more than one file to commit, and you want to commit all of them at the same time with the same message, you say "git commit -a -m "bla bla" ". 

If you want to create a new file that was never in the repo before, you need to first add it and then do the same steps as before. 
git add sample_new_file.txt

git commit -m "scripts for something" sample_new_file.txt
git pull 
git push 

Create a new file with your sample latex code in it an push it to this repo!
